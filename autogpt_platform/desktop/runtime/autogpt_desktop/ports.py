The appliance owns its network namespace and hardcodes every port. A desktop
shares the machine with whatever else the user runs, so each port is picked
free on first boot and remembered, then re-used for as long as it stays free.
Keeping the public port stable matters most: it is the origin that browser
sessions and OAuth redirect URIs are tied to.
