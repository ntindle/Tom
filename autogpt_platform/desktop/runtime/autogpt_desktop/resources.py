"""How much of the machine the stack takes.

Every backend service imports the whole backend, about 600 MB of it, so the
number of interpreters decides the footprint: eight services in eight
processes held 5.7 GB idle, the same eight in three hold under half of that.
A profile says how the services are grouped into processes and how many
agent runs and AutoPilot turns may be in flight at once. It is chosen from
the machine and can be set in config/settings.env:

    AUTOGPT_DESKTOP_PROFILE=compact | balanced | isolated

`isolated` is one process per service, as the appliance runs them, with the
backend's own pool sizes. It is the layout to fall back on, and to compare
against, when a merged process misbehaves.
