"""The Prisma CLI, which applies the database migrations.

Before any command the CLI makes sure it has a query engine and a schema
engine, and fetches what it does not find from binaries.prisma.sh into its
own package directory: a download nobody pinned, written into the bundle, on
the user's machine. By default the query engine it wants is the Node-API
library for whatever platform it detects (on a Linux with OpenSSL 1.1 and 3
both installed it picks 1.1), which the bundle does not carry.

An engine named in the environment is taken as it is, with no look at the
package directory, the download cache or the network. The bundle has the two
engines as executables (build_runtime.py, step_prisma), so the CLI is told to
use the executable query engine and given both paths. `migrate deploy` only
ever runs the schema engine.
