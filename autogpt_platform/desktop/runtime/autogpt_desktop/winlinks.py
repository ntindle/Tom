"""Windows only: a second way to a directory, whose path RabbitMQ's batch
scripts can take.

They cannot take a space, and the 8.3 short name that normally stands in for
a long one does not exist on a volume that has short names turned off: the
default for every drive but the system one, and a setting on that one too. A
user called "John Smith" on such a machine has a space in every path under
their profile. A directory junction does what the short name did, and making
one needs no privilege.

Where the junctions live decides who can point them somewhere else, and
RabbitMQ reads its configuration and its cookie through them:

* under %LOCALAPPDATA%, when that path (or its short name) is itself usable.
  It is the user's own profile, as private as the data directory.
* otherwise directly under %ProgramData%, in a folder named after the install
  and the user's SID. %ProgramData% has no user's name in it; only
  administrators can rename or delete what is in it, but any user can create
  a folder there. So the folder is created closed to everyone but its user,
  the system and administrators, in the one call that creates it, and one
  that is already there is used only when it is a real directory, owned by
  one of those three, that nobody else may change. All of that is read from
  one open handle to the folder, never from its path a second time: whoever
  made the folder could otherwise show a different object to each question.
  A folder that passes cannot be moved or replaced by anyone but those
  three, so the path stays what was checked. Another user of the machine
  can take the name first; that makes the app say it cannot run, and never
  lets them redirect it.

Each install of the app (install.py) has a folder of its own in either place.
