"""The desktop runtime against the appliance it is a port of.

autogpt_platform/single-container is upstream's; the desktop runtime does by
hand what its scripts do. Each test here reads one appliance file as text and
compares it with what the desktop does, so that an upstream change which
needs a desktop change fails the upstream sync with what changed and where to
port it, and everything else flows through.

The files are read as their statements, not as their layout: comments, blank
lines, indentation and how a command is wrapped over lines make no difference.

Every intentional difference is an entry in a table below, with its reason.
A table entry that no longer matches anything fails too: waivers do not
outlive what they waive.

Where the desktop mirrors a piece by hand and nothing finer can be compared,
the piece's digest is pinned (HAND_PORTED): any change to its statements
fails with "review the diff and re-pin".

Nothing here imports the backend, the proxy or the build: those are read as
text, so the tests run wherever the unit tests do.
