"""The fork differs from upstream in one directory and one workflow file.

Everything the desktop app is lives under autogpt_platform/desktop, plus the
workflow that hands a commit to the build. Any other difference is a file
upstream also edits, and so a merge conflict waiting for the daily sync. Where
the desktop needs upstream's code to behave differently it works around it
from its own side (settings.WindowsOs) and offers the change upstream
(desktop/upstream/).

The rule is the `desktop` branch's. A variant (`variant/<slug>`, README
"Variants") exists to differ from upstream, and is not held to it.
