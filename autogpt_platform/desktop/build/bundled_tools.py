"""`<bundle>/tools/bin`: programs the backend runs by their plain name.

ffmpeg is the first. The backend's locked dependencies already bring one,
inside the imageio-ffmpeg wheel, under a name only that package knows
(`ffmpeg-win-x86_64-v7.1.exe`). The backend also runs `ffmpeg` by name
(blocks/video/_utils.py, the onboarding transcription) and so does yt-dlp for
the video download block, and none of them finds it there. The binary is
moved, not copied (it is 80 MB), to `tools/bin/ffmpeg`; the runtime puts that
directory on the services' PATH and names the file in IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE,
which is where imageio-ffmpeg looks first (runtime settings.py).

The three wheels carry three different builds, by three builders (ORIGINS),
so nothing about the build is assumed: the binary is asked what it is, it
must be the build this file knows the origin of, the licence it is conveyed
under is shipped beside it with a note of where its source is, and a build
that may not be redistributed, or whose origin is not known, stops the bundle
being made.
